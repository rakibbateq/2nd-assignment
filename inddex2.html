                    <h1>Fozlur Rohman Khan</h1>
                    <p>Fozlur Rôhman Khan; 3 April 1929 – 27 March 1982) was a Bangladeshi-American[3] structural engineer and architect, who initiated important structural systems for skyscrapers.[4][5][6] Considered the "father of tubular designs" for high-rises,[7] Khan was also a pioneer in computer-aided design (CAD). He was the designer of the Sears Tower, since renamed Willis Tower, the tallest building in the world from 1973 until 1998, and the 100-story John Hancock Center.
        
                        A partner in the firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in Chicago, Khan, more than any other individual, ushered in a renaissance in skyscraper construction during the second half of the 20th century.[8][9] He has been called the "Einstein of structural engineering" and the "Greatest Structural Engineer of the 20th Century" for his innovative use of structural systems that remain fundamental to modern skyscraper design and construction.[4][10] In his honor, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat established the Fazlur Khan Lifetime Achievement Medal, as one of their CTBUH Skyscraper Awards.
                        
                        Although best known for skyscrapers, Khan was also an active designer of other kinds of structures, including the Hajj airport terminal, the McMath–Pierce solar telescope and several stadium structures.[11][12]</p>
